This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a user management app using Supabase and Next.js. It includes:

- Supabase Database: a Postgres database for storing your user data.
- Supabase Auth: users can sign in with magic links (no passwords, only email).
- Supabase Storage: users can upload a photo.
- Row Level Security: data is protected so that individuals can only access their own data.
- Instant APIs: APIs will be automatically generated when you create your database tables.
